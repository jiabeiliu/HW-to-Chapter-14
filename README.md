How can we add GUI to a Java program?

To add a graphical user interface (GUI) to a Java program, developers can use the Java Foundation Classes (JFC), which include Swing and Java 2D. Swing, a part of JFC, is a set of classes that provide more powerful and flexible components than the Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT). Here’s a simple process to add GUI to a Java program using Swing:

Import Swing and AWT Packages: Start by importing necessary classes from the javax.swing and java.awt packages.
Create the Frame: Use JFrame class to create the main window. JFrame serves as the base window on which other components like buttons, labels, text fields can be added.
Add GUI Components: Add GUI components to the frame using classes like JButton, JLabel, JTextField, etc. These components need to be added to a JPanel or directly to the JFrame’s content pane.
Set Frame Properties: Customize the frame by setting its size, default close operation, layout, and visibility.
Event Handling: Implement event listeners to handle user interactions with the GUI components.
What is AWT - Abstract Windowing Toolkit?

The Abstract Windowing Toolkit (AWT) is Java's original platform-independent windowing, graphics, and user-interface widget toolkit. AWT is part of the Java Foundation Classes (JFC) — the standard API for providing a graphical user interface (GUI) for a Java program. AWT components are heavyweight, meaning they are rendered by the native operating system's windowing system. This can lead to differences in appearance and behavior across different platforms. AWT provides a set of classes for GUI components like buttons, menus, windows, and for graphics and imaging tools including shapes, colors, and fonts.

What is Swing?

Swing is a part of Java Foundation Classes (JFC) that provides a set of lightweight (non-native) GUI components. Unlike AWT components which are considered heavyweight, Swing components are independent of the native windowing system, thereby offering a uniform look and feel across various platforms. Swing provides a richer set of components than AWT, including trees, tables, text areas with built-in scrolling, tabbed panes, and more. Swing components are prefixed with J (e.g., JButton, JFrame). It supports pluggable look and feel, allowing the appearance of applications to change dynamically to match the native look and feel of different operating systems or a completely custom appearance.
